Glad you're doing great OP. You're now the top post of all time on this subreddit. Who would have guessed wholesome r/RoastMe would be our most popular post. 

I edited your flair. Take care of yourself.

[Thread in question if you're OOTL](https://www.reddit.com/r/RoastMe/comments/alo3ao/17_years_old_russian_with_crippling_depression/)

Edit: comments brigading this sticky are moderated. Read the sidebar rules. It gets better, once you realize there’s more to life than track suits.As a Russian are you obligated to dress as the stereotype?

Glad you’re smiling this time 

EDIT: thanks for the gold stranger Sometimes the line between life and suicide is as thin as your hair. 

Stay strong dude. You're a perfectly valid person and we care about all people as long as they aren't dicks. 

That being said, how does it feel to look 12 and 57 at the same time?Seeing everyone come out in support really made me smile.
But anyways the top of your head looks my lint rollerYour support is amazing, I feel like I can actually be roasted this time. Dont hold back!You don't look like you could kick anything's ass. Except depression's.

Edit: wow, my first ever gold and silver! Thanks kind strangers!

Edit 2: thanks for the platinum!Your penmanship is terrible!I had the same haircut once, I was about 1s old I almost cried in public. Fuck youDad of a 17 year old here, late to the game and had to go back and read the first post.  I usually read through the roasts with my jaw dropped with thoughts of "dang, that's brutal" but my jaw is dropped for a different reason this time.  My friend, there are truly people in this world who care about you, even if they are strangers from around the world.  The support you have received is evidence of that.  Never forget that, and when thoughts of the opposite creep in, please go back and read these threads.  Reach out to those people who said to do that, have a conversation, play an online game, whatever it takes to get your mind off the situation at that point in time.  Things will always get better, I assure you of that - I am living proof.  I am sitting here with tears running down my face knowing exactly how you feel and it also hits closer to home as a dad to someone your same age.

I am so proud of this community and subreddit, something I never thought I would ever say (haha) but I will not leave without a roast, so I will roast the Redditors posting in these threads.  In the words of the all wise Jerry Springer audiences throughout the years......GO TO OPRAH, GO TO OPRAH!!!!!


EDIT: Thanks for the Silver, my first award ever!

EDIT 2: Thanks for the Gold!This is the second worst Nike advertisement after 2018 TV ad.



Jokes apart. I hope your recovery is going well. Time can be hard at you but you keep studying and smiling. :)I knew there was a gorgeous smile hiding there...You still look like a dropped lollipop. Glad you updated, with a smile :)I joined reddit after seeing your post on my Facebook page.  I tried to take my life when I was 19.  I'm thankful every day that someone found me in time.  I'm now 41 with 2 beautiful kids.  Life will always have its ups and downs but like a roller coaster, always remember when you're seriously down, you will eventually always come up.  Always.  Sending love your way. <3Wipe that fucking grin off your face. Your happiness is contagious.Russian Bobby Hill.I love this guy, if any of you guyz have depression too, please seek for help as soon as possible <3You look like a Young Uncle Fester. I see Cousin IT too, behind that tree, breaking up weed in a turned over frisbee. 


Had to hit you with something. Keep your head up and your dick in your pants until someone asks to see it. You should be fine. 

EDIT: Weirdly enough the fucking guy above me told you to “show your pp”, completely ruining my advice. I didn’t see it because he was downvoted. So let me revise my advice. 


Keep your head up and your dick in your pants until someone wants to see it AND, you want to show it to them. 


Cheers!Please dont make your life as short as your hairI bet your knowledge about sex is as dense as your hair and as wide as your eyes <3. Eyes are brighter today.Never seen the fake glasses-big noise disguise be used without a moustache as well**Listen up motherfucker!** You will not give up, is that understood? I don’t care how shitty life is right now. I don’t care how hopeless and little light you find in it or in yourself. You will NOT give up!

Depression is the cancer of the mind. What you have is a disease, one that can easily cause your end just like any other cancer. The only difference here is fighting relies solely on you. So fight it! 

Every time you get a thought like “I am not good enough” or “The world would be a better place without me” that’s the cancer talking, not you. That is the disease dragging you thought by thought to places you shouldn’t be. 

**Do. Not. Let. It.**

Know your enemy. Identify these thoughts as such: The painful pangs of a disease. What you will do is tell these thoughts “Fuck you, no!”. Rationalise through them. “The world wouldn’t be better off without me. Because of me a bunch of heartless motherfuckers united into being kind. No one ever did that.”. Or “So and so sees the good in me. Why can’t I?”. Or something along those lines. Get creative. Have fun. 

And for fucks sake see a professional. Sure, you are strong and all but cmon man. Professionals are there for a reasons. Medicine might not have found a cure for what ails you, but it sure as shit has made big advances. 

More on talking to someone helps big time. The thoughts bouncing in your head all day start to come out and you see them in a different light. You also see your self and life in one narrow perspective. Talking to someone gives you a different one.

You are Russian, aren’t you? You vodka drinking bastards beat the second scariest thing to the cancer of depression: Nazis. So if your people can beat Nazis, you can beat this thing. Embody your russianness you beautiful, pasty bastard. 

Look I’m not going to lie and tell you doing a few of these things will magically make things rosey. They won’t. But your healing is a journey, one that can take a long time. 
You are who you are, own it. Know your strengths and work on the flaws that bother you. Adopt that mentality and you'll find with time you will grow to be a stronger person and a better man.
This shit will be hard. Like…real hard. On the good days things will be..meh. On the bad days you will fall back to old habits and wonder why the fuck should you keep going, it’s easier to just give up. Do. Not. Fucking. Give. Up. Do not let a temporary feeling define you. 

And one day, maybe in a year or 10 years, you will meet someone you fall madly in love with. Someone that makes you happy and want to do the impossible just to make them smile. You will then appreciate the painful personal growth you went through to become the man who deserves a woman like her. Or man, whatever. I don’t know what you like sticking your pencil dick into.
You will be proud of how far you’ve come, and you’ll want to go further. And if you have kids you will be filled to brim with hard-taught wisdom to pass on them. None of that will happen if you give up now.

So keep your chin up. You are not alone. You are loved. You are wanted. You are valuable. You are also balding. 

Many of these beautiful assholes offered you advice and a listening ear. I would like to humbly put my name on that list. If you ever need someone to listen, or just some good old though love, I’m a message away.

**P.S. You have a nice smile. But that track suit? Painfully stereotypical.** 
 Now that he feels ok, can we stop being so nice??[deleted]Yes mate, great to see you looking a bit brighter. Keep going into school and keep smiling. With a smile like that you'll be winning the hearts of those ladies around you (if that's your preference) in no time. 

That said, it looks way too sunny to be out today with skin that pale. Get inside or you won't need this sub to roast you. Looks like you scalped a baby and used it on your head. You ruined this sub. Now everybody will post pictures of themselves saying “I have depression, end my life” and people will comfort them, thank you. 

Jokes aside, I’m glad you’re better.
You remind me of Fungus from Monsters inc. but instead your heart was warmed by strangers.

PS: I love you mate☺️. Yes Homo.Stay Strong 💪

PPS: I did a reverse “no homo” for you comrade, it’s worth it ;)We can finally talk about that god awful haircutYou're not even squatting, fake SlavDo you cut your hair with a vacuum?

Also glad to see you smiling.Is it a law that all Russians have to wear a track suit? 

But seriously.  Get your mind right.  This world is too amazing to not want to be in it. Hope you get the help you need. Congrats on losing the only thing people cared about you for.I love how the comments are some sort of broken mix of support and roasts. Anyways, good to see you're doing well OP.I fucken feel for you dude. I’ve attempted suicide 3 times and I’m only 22. After the last time I looked at my life and realized there are reasons to be around and always hope you can find yours. There is always help wherever you look. All you have to do is speak up. Stay strong and remember you’re important. 

And if you really want a roast here goes : you look like Nikola Jokić after anorexia. Glad you’re okay my friend. I’m a veteran, I have friends and family that deals with depression, on a daily basis. Those that have it have tread that beaten trail many of times. 

I know the dark corners all to well. But glad you pulled yourself out, and have a different outlook and perspective on things. 



The tree behind you has a dick bigger than yours...Just shave it off man, this is too painful for us. Your handwriting is average at best!

Glad you're doing well. Keep going and when things start to fall apart again like they always do, remember this. And don't be afraid to reach out, even to strangers on the internet.You don't roast an egg, you fry it or scramble itLmao I’m 8 months into cancer treatment, and I STILL have better hair than you

It still feels wrong, I'm proud of you. This post made me break down and cry after a long day's work. It's hard to come to grips with the hurt and pain you'll leave behind if you do end it. I realize I must get help, before it's too late.I’m crying looking at this post of you in the sunshine with that beautiful smile on your face. 

Is that what you like to do-make a grown man cry first thing in the morning? Boom, roasted!u/The88car said in your last post you look like a guy that would have gigantic, awesome smile...and you know what You do..Keep smiling even when life's hard sometimes..Just know you made some random stranger happy with that smileI love the fact that there are, at this time, almost 12k people rooting for you minimum. 12000 people on your side. I'm still going to pass my dude. Love seeing you smile man, keep on keeping on. I repeat, Will the real slim shady please stand So handsome!Nice try fucking retard you can't make us roast you.

And remember, if you ever feel like having your head in the clouds, we bring you back down to earth.

Great to see you smiling my friend :) Great smile!  Nice eyes - sparkling!  Great to see you posting here!  You are loved and supported. Your hair also gives its respects. It’s a tough road being a teen & suffering from mental illness. Congrats on that smile! Onwards and upwards, friend!It gets better. Still, I'm concerned about that trail of bodies behind youI don't know how but all these roasts are super wholesome.  Faith in humanity restored :)Is the grass fake?

Edit: Also tell whoever drew your hair on that they did a fantastic job 👍

Edit2: damn I see you're a pretty talented artist, must've done it yourselfThat is the happiest smile I've ever seen. I hope you're doing better man. When I saw that you hadn't posted/commented anything since your original post, I started to get worried, but then I see this as the first post when I got on today. Truly warmed my heart. 
I'm usually a lurker, so I hope it's okay if I cant come up with a roast, lol. You're a great person, I hope you know that.When the world seems to be the darkest you have ever seen, remember that there is always light somewhere. You just have to find it. I hope that you strive everyday to find the light in your world, as I do in mine. You are loved and people want you to be alive. Who knew that Caillou was actually based on a real person.

We all love you, and the world is better with you in it.I don't roast cancer survivors. We like to have fun here, but know when something’s up. Stay strong my friendGive yourself about 5 more minutes sitting in that direct sunlight. You’ll get there. It’s crazy to see the community come together and provide such an amazing atmosphere. I hope this is an example to others who may be struggling to reach out. There are so many people who are willing to just talk even! 

I was scrolling and saw the original roast me for this man, and I wouldn’t think of it. Seeing that ear to ear grin now is absolutely awesome.This made my day!!You look like Austin Powers and Vladimir Putin has a baby. 


(Equally sexy men)You look like a newborn teenager You said you were Russian last time, but that jacket clearly says Nike, not Adidas. Quit the bsWho are we roasting? I'm stuck admiring the ass on the girl behind the tree. You have such a great smile. It makes me happy. Stay strong! If you ever start struggling just know that many people on this sub or in your life will be willing to support you. Also, I wish I had the self-confidence that you had to post your own picture!Your hair makes you look like you were born 2 hours ago.I can come back to this post and look at your smile when I'm feeling down, and my day can be brightened within seconds. The transition of someone suffering from depression to sheer happiness within three days truly is a spectacle. I'm happy to see that you've gotten this far, and I'm also happy to see that the roasting overloards of /r/RoastMe know when to back off, and realize when something is not right. I'm proud of everyone here, and I will soon be able to match their roasting abilities. You guys are awesome!



Even in the deepest, darkest depths of life, you should never give up hope. Always remember that, no matter what may come your way. Godspeed, my friend!Your MOM thanked me for support ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)Who drew your hairDamn you’re still here...Did you draw those hair with a sharpee?
But seriously man good for you. Whos holding the camera? I want to see who made that new smile a thing.Faith in humanity restored Your head looks like a kiwiI feel like a lot of your problems would be solved with a better haircut.Your socks are different lengths. Both lengths are wrong. Get better socks.One of the most stereotypical Russian pics I've ever seen.Oh dear God!!Nike jacket with Adidas shoes, boi you're already insulting yourselfGlad to see you're doing so much better, at least you can be happy with who you truly are.

A gayEven the depression can't stick with youThought I saw a dick on the tree but I realized it was just you.You must’ve asked a random stranger to take this picture because I know you don’t have any friends. Mr Potato Head all grown up Alright don’t beg for attention now Look like yetiThat smile!!! You’re doing amazing!!! 

There’s subreddits for people struggling with mental health. I recommend giving r/depression a look :-) I joined reddit after seeing your story on my Facebook! Such kind people!

I swear this is the history we made cry behind his desk. I dont know what's going on with your situation but if having cancer and aids at the same time makes you look like this I hope I just die a quick death. It's too wholesome!!! Now i know why nike stock plummeted over night.... Cause people saw you wearing one...Hi again! This isn't a roast, just wanted to say, I'm so happy to see you smiling!Now this restores a little bit my faith in this weird society.Glad we could help, now stop wearing Nike and Adidas at the same time.

We got you man Oh hey look, the guy with bad hair and depression got a track suit. 

Your country has nearly 150 million people, but they decided to give internet access to the one who is determined to become a racist's caricature of a Russian.

Let us know when you decide to give in to alcohol abuse and writing bleak novels so we can enjoy watching your spiral down the drain, "comrade."This guy has a 5 o clock shadow on his nosePlease brush your teethGlad to see your doing better bro!

I like your shoes though....Glad you’re feeling better you commieWhat a great update!Beautiful smile. You have plenty who care about you. I struggle with depression and BPII. Reach out to me if things get hard. It took me 15 years to finally listen to people and get some help. That saved my life. Much love I'm so glad it ended like this. sorry. Not gonna roast. Beautiful smile !!!!! xxxxI hope you nuke your Depression as hard as America will probably end up nuking your country :) This is my favourite post / response / repost I've ever encountered on Reddit, or any platform of total strangers. Faith in humanity slowly being restored! You know when you drop your lollypop on the carpet then pick it back up...Dude, im really sorry that i posted a roast about you without knowing about your actual condition. All the best in ivercoming it ! :)My heart skipped a beat and my eyes welled up when I saw your face smiling on the front page. You look like someone who’s ready to turn shit around since you turned that frown upside down. 
Also Russians wouldn’t be caught dead in Nikes you traitor. Adidas for life!! and please respect the stripes and squat, next time you have your pic taken! 

All that aside so happy to see this. My heart is genuinely happy for you and so proud of Reddit people for being human. Sending you hugs and positive thoughts buddy! Stay strong and smile 🥰😊Can someone please explain instead of making this infuriating????Havent stopped thinking about your thread from the other day! What a beautiful difference! So happy to see you smiling in the sun brother!

You again? Whyyyyy! This post is worth 35-40$US just from the reddit coins given Can we roast him now? My wife wanted to ask if you had some kind of cancer.When the thoughts come back, and they likely will, because it's the nature of the beast - you just stay alive. Sometimes that's all we can do. Stay alive until things are okay again. 

Also, your pants are too short. What are you... some kind of person who doesn't know where the pants store is?  BOOM #roasted I’d feel bad about going full-roast this soon.  I’m glad to see you’re out getting some sun!  Even more than that, I’m glad you’re still here and I love how badly you want to be roasted lol.  I hope you’ve gone and seen a doc.  Depression doesn’t go away that easily (at least in my experience with it).  Long term therapy is clutch.  Bless you, brother!

It's important that we stop the spread. There's people as young as 12 in critical care, and teenagers have died. You aren't safe if you're young. Things that you, yes you, can do to stop the spread:

* Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water, multiple times a day
* Wear a mask
* Avoid touching your face
* Cover your coughs and sneezes
* **Stay at home!**

(Seriously though, it’s not you) It’s the photographer and they way they posed you. You also shouldn’t wear red, if you were in a darker color, black, dark green/blood/brown -like your center roast me pic- and the angle of the photos were shot anywhere near professionally it would have turned out great! I’m an amateur photographer and I know more about posing and angles then whoever shot this, it’s more a roast of the photographer in my view!

"7.4 million karma and graduated from Harvard, but never kissed a girl -roast me!"

-/u/etymologynerdNever kissed a girl?! Try telling her about your karma points and admission certificate next timeHarry Potter and The Virgin’s Curse.I appreciate that your chin has a dick rest built in. Makes t bagging much more efficientThe first time I posted this it was taken down because I looked under 18, which I guess is a roast in itselfReplace Harvard with hogswarts and I'll believe youMillionaire by 25, suicide by 27.Look at one of those maps behind you. Point your finger at a random spot. Magically, the panties of all the girls in that spot dry up immediately.Too bad karma is worthless and can’t pay that $80k a year.The weirdest flex I’ve ever seen
‘I spend too much time on the internet but I’m in Harvard but I’m also a huge virgin’

Whack[deleted]Jesus wept, when did you find out your mum had an affair with Buzz Lightyear.Getting accepted to Harvard isn't a substitute for having an actual personality.Even as a 48-year old lesbian, you can't score[deleted]I’ve heard the term “cuntpickle” used before, but never saw a picture of one until just now.I’ll take “Reasons OP dies alone” for 200 Alex.I didn't know Lewis from Meet the Robinsons had a retarded brother???The fact you put how much karma you have over your Harvard acceptance tells me how pathetic your life really is.By the time a girl drops her standards low enough to get with you syphilis will be doing all the roasting you'll ever needI’m not gonna roast someone who could be a future employer.. I’m not Harvard smart but I’m not stupid.Harry Potter and the extra chromosome.You look like [Eugene Levy](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0506405/)'s  ignored son.I don’t even have to try, the title says it allIt looks like there are live crickets in your mouth and you’re trying to keep them from escapingLet’s not forget Issac newton died a virgin but found gravity so bitch u better find something amazingIt's going to be hard going to Harvard when you're not allowed within 50 feet of a school zone.That is a lot of karma for someone who is going to reincarnate as a fruit fly.You look like the brother of Harry Potter that no one talks about and isn't allowed within 1,000 feet of an elementary school.Oh look, a certificate to clarify he’s a virginYour lips look like they are so scared of actually kissing a girl that they are retreating into your faceOk, I'm gonna be real here. You got into Harvard. You're already better than 99% of redditors, including those in this thread. And quite frankly most roasts here are weak. They reek of jealousy. Your future is looking bright while all these guys can do is call out your virginity. I bet this must be the happiest week of your life.



Enjoy it while it lasts. Sure you got into Harvard, but are you truly happy? Do you have a sense of self-fulfillment, or are you just some smart kid who took a bunch of APs because your self-esteem is so low that you wouldn't dare to reach outside of your comfort zone?



You know what's gonna happen once you get into Harvard? You look like the kind of kid who's gonna be all alone during pre-frosh weekend. You'll live in a dorm but never talk to your roommate. Or anybody for that fact, because you're an awkward fuck with no real interests and charisma. You'll take CS 50 and Ma23 or some shit that isn't quite Ma55 but not a beginner class either, and think you'll own it because you were the smartest kid at your school. Turns out you're a dolt, and that talent you had will get you nowhere because it's the equivalent of a basketball bencher at a mediocre DI college. After getting your ass kicked the first semester, you'll be taking the easiest classes because it's the only way you'll graduate with a degree.



Impostor syndrome will hit you hard. You'll go to therapy every week and label yourself as yet another depressed millennial. Or Gen Z, whatever. Actually, you probably already do. I mean, you have 3.2 million karma which indicates some serious need for validation. But you're nowhere close to prepared for how intense that feeling will get.



At the end of those 4 years, you'll feel empty. You'll notice that some people got great work done while all you did was reddit and study because you struggled to even get a passing grade. At best you're going to become another cog in the machine. Maybe you'll throw your life away at the first sign of a girl who tolerates you, because you're the kind of incel who thinks getting a girl is the greatest accomplishment imaginable.. The only way you'll get a Wikipedia page is if you become the next Unabomber. 



The kids with \*real\* talent will change the world. But all you'll be able to say is that you graduated from Harvard. Granted, initially that'll pique the interest of a lot of people and you'll get some opportunities that you otherwise wouldn't have deserved. But as soon as they get to work with you they'll understand how pathetic you really are. 20 years from now, that degree from Harvard will add nothing to your resume. You're gonna go through a mid life crisis like everybody else. You're gonna be more lonely than anybody else. They say success is 10% IQ and 90% EQ. You've got 0 EQ, so prepare to be the smartest IT guy in some unknown company.Someone at Harvard will get drunk enough to kiss you don’t worryYou know you're a real turd when getting into Harvard is easier than getting into a girls pants.I couldn't tell if you are an pissed feminist or a disturbed gayI hope you get draftedGood lord.  You look like an autistic version of Harry Potter after he got hit with the Stinging Jinx.  May god have mercy on your....well...whatever.God damn it, I went to your post history for ammunition and all I found was fucking wholesomeness.You look exactly how I expected, nerd.After the first two, the third is kind of a given...Harry Potter’s retarded cousin, Harry Pothead. Also, how the hell do you have 3 million karma?Fuck a roast boi, congratulations. Get it!Yo adam is that you???The amount of real life ‘good karma’ a girl would gain by kissing you would be so infinite and unimaginable that the very mere thought of it alone would bring Buddha himself to the edge of insanity trying to comprehend how to possibly repay her for such a noble sacrifice. The debt would be so large that anything short of making her a God herself, would be an insignificant and unmatched attempt.Your chin looks like it would take a Harvard made tool to unlock.3.2 mill karma, huh? I see you’re serious about POSSIBLY getting laid by getting into Harvard. Good luck.Dude, I’m not here to roast. Get some stylish glasses and take those things off. Go immediately to your local frames store and please buy something that isn’t the “giant nerd” category of glasses. After that, see a professional barber who will do something with your hair. These two things will change your life dramatically. And if you don’t know how to dress watch a couple episodes of Queer Eye on Netflix and figure it out. 

You’re going to Harvard now. You’ll be a professional at some profession soon. Time to lose the middle school nerd look cause it doesn’t suit you. 

Be confident.You’re pompous lol your life will be one big roastWhat's the point of roasting you, if your parents roasted you from birth by saying that you can become whatever you want, not knowing that you would end up being a virgin in a suicide story...You look like you wouldn't care that I broke my elbowIt looks like you decided to change gender. Then gave up halfway throughYou ain't a virgin. 

Reddit fucked you hard.

So will school.

Your basically a pornstar with the fucking that has happened in the last 3 hours.Get on some dating apps bro. I bet there's some women that dream of de-virginizing someone. Be patient. Let them come to you.

Edit: oh yea, roast hahahaI have a feeling that while at Harvard you’ll have the nickname, “Fuckface.”I don’t wanna say inbreeding, but you are likely the result of multiple genetic defectsDon't worry about girls, trust me, nowadays, the later the better.Surely you were captain of the ‘Bate Team.All those maps on the wall behind you but you’ll die feeling that you never got where you wanted to be in life.Congratulations! You're going to do what all my friends who attended Harvard have done; say you went there, become assistant manager at Outback Steakhouse and host Renaissance fairs in your yard for your step kids.Since youre looking like a lesbian, maybe you should stop trying with straight girls?Never kissed a girl... Plenty of stuffed animals though.Someone squish it before it flies away.imma give you some real advice

just judging by face structure you need to wait for puberty and get a beard

also get hair cut holy shit

also contacts

hope the chin dimple gets more pronounced and not whatever the fuck it is right now

dont wear the harvard merch just go for the education not the clout

believe me noone thinks the jacket gives you clout

5/10 on the eyebrows, lots of work to be done, ask any woman you know for help on that one

hope to god ur degree gives you a nice salary so you can pay for prostitutesi love these pricks who stret their "success" then pretend to be humble, like "i cured cancer, saved 8 puppies from a fire, and just got accepted into the mars colonization program, but im a virgin #roastme" like, no one cares.  you are still an ugly, stuck up guy who cant get girls because your ego is bigger than the fucking death star.Harry Potter and the prisoner of spazkabanYour odds aren’t going to get any better at Harvard.You might want to just go ahead and get used to not being kissed.Didnt you just roast yourself?You kinda look like Harry Potter when Hermione used that puffy face spellYou will kiss a girl that is passed out soon. Don’t worryYou sir, are the reason Reddit has a bad repThe balls on your chin have seen more pussy than youYour face looks like it's made from clayYou look like a nice guy, and you should be proud of yourself for accomplishing acceptance to Harvard. That’s amazing.you look like a guy who’d find an e-gf on a college admissions subreddit and then she’d delete her account after seeing your faceI know you're expecting a roast but congratulations man. Hopefully you'll get to kiss a girl in Harvard.How many guys have you kissed thoJesus man you already bought the sweater huh? You're going to invest every fiber of your self identity and self value as a "Harvard Student" and you'll lose anything that even makes you remotely interesting in the process. And then, when you graduate you won't know yourself, you'll be a shell of a man with a high level degree and you'll become an annoying ass alumni that still wears the sweater everywhere because that sweater will become a retainer for your soul after you burn yourself out on your education. When your ugly wife finds you dead of a self inflicted mortal wound, you'll be in that sweater and your story will be uttered as a cautionary tale for kids to "do what they really love" instead of wrapping their entire personality into a university. Oh yeah by the way, Harvard is slowly becoming a far left echo chamber of safetyism that doesn't prepare their students for life. You'll learn from some of the smartest people on the planet, and yet you'll be unprepared for basic life. Good luck.Maybe you shouldn’t be holding all your jizz in your mouth, next time you wank point it away from your face.Bachelor of Arts. In a couple of years, you’re gonna be a Harvard graduate working at Starbucks with someone who didn’t even attend college.

Edit: everyone pointing out “yOu iLLiterAtE, DoNt yOu KnOW wHaT ArtS baChelOR MeaN??” must be really fun at parties. Stop trying to apply logic to roasts cause it’s not how this sub works. 

Anyways, I get it, this degree does qualify for a better job, maybe I should have gone for “olive garden waiter”.You deadass remind me of this one picture of my down syndrome uncle wearing those huge glasses from the 80sAttaboy! Congratulations on Harvard!You can’t kiss anyone if you don’t have any lips 🤷🏻‍♂️I'm pretty sure pre-teens aren't allows in Harvard but ok...You didn't have to say you never kissed an girl, we could already tell.Too bad they don’t teach dating at HarvardThat caption though...
Dude you've roasted yourself harder than anyone  here ever could.

He did the rabbit-move.3.2 million redditors and not a single one will fuck you.Mellissa Ethridge and Harry Potter“Lois.. lois look I’m in Harvard”When girls come to your room they expect band or movie posters. Not fucking maps.Squirward really let himself goYou look like Lewis from Meet The Robinson’sUncle what are you doing hereJesus fucking Christ your post history is a boring and desperate attempt of gaining fake internet points. 

Not a roast, but a really depressing observation.You look like deflated condomYou can practice kissing your chinDon't worry. At least there are plenty of asses to kiss where you are going.Shame you cant spend Karma on hand jobs.Cool that you got into Harvard! I feel like some positivity needs to be spread every now and then in these comment section :-)Yeah but how many boys have you kissed?So just by yourself you got into one of the few places you won’t find anyone stupid enough to fuck you eitherYou look just as worthless as your 3 million karma are in real lifeHey, roasting aside for a sec, congrats dude!That’s a pretty good forgery job on that letter. Hey look on the bright side at least you good at somethingIt's ok, once you are old and rich you'll have lots of gold diggers willing to do it with youThis comment chain is for compliments only
You have nice hair and I'm proud of you for getting into harvardIt's cool to be present at the start of UNIBOMBER 2.0.You look like the love child of dan Radcliffe and and Rocky Davis. Good think you got in, I hope that degree covers some of those face lumps. If a blind girl touched your face she would guess is a large sculpture of Owen Wilson’s fucked up nose and Joaquin Phoenix’s hairlip.I know this is supposed to be a roast but holy fuck, I’ve never seen someone with so much karma before."I asked REDDIT to ROAST ME!! 😰"

I could say Verizon wireless is shit and that I prefer Sprint, but we all know that. They support the removal of net neutrality because they don’t pull as many customers as other providers which keeps their confidence nice and low.

Why is every subreddit posting about this dumb shitPai  you fucking sand monkey hope you burn in hell you vile piece of shit I mean, why am I supposed to care about this every year? And furthermore how do you know something is bad if it has never happened? And thirdly why are companies not allowed to do as they please with the privately owned service that they provide? Actually curious about these questions and would like to hear an answer instead of a bunch of people just calling me a misogynistic racist nazi facist if possible. Thx. Here's the deal...

I think 99% of people who are plastering reddit and social media about this are just regurgitating the BS they've been fed and don't really understand the economic relationship between businesses and the internet, or between the internet and the government.

The whole thing is intended to scapegoat "corporations" and paint them as nefarious (which they may be), while ignoring the fact that such monopolies wouldn't exist if it weren't for regulatory burdens imposed by the FCC. IMO, the only reason reddit is such an echo chamber on this issue is that people have been making a fuss about it for years, spreading propaganda to make people believe that the internet as we know it will be gone forever if NN went away.
Nothing could be further from the truth.

The internet is, by its very nature, decentralized. It's only become centralized because big interests saw the potential early on and invested in the infrastructure and then took steps working with regulators to keep out competition, which is why we now have only a handful of national providers.

But with decentralized internet technology that is coming, such as IPFS, we soon will be able to be our own internet providers on an individual level. The idea that we even need companies to provide internet access for businesses and consumers is soon going to go the way of the dinosaur. This will make the whole NN debate completely moot.

The problem I see is that people think the way it is now is how it's always going to be, and that appeals to government are the only way to fight centralization. But if the problem is too much centralization, why do people think appealing to the most central authority figure is going to remedy that problem? It's backwards thinking on so many levels. These same people would probably be celebrating in the streets if the government just decided to take control of the industry and be the only service provider nationwide. Hey, who wouldn't want free internet access for all? (That's how they would sell it to the public.)

That is, until they find out that the same government providing everyone with internet access is also monitoring everything they do online and using that information to manipulate and control the population. That, I think, is the ultimate goal. NN is being forced down our throats as a means to get the public on board with more government control of the internet. The whole thing is a wolf in sheep's clothing.

Also, when any comment that even asks a question about specifics of NN, let alone question the narrative, automatically gets downvoted to oblivion, you know there's something up.I'm so proud of Ajit Pai. I think you all should be. Admit it, there's no other Indian who could look innocent and pull off such a dumb stunt. #Ashitguy last # i will be able to use b4 Ajit Pai chokes on his own bullsh*t and internet taxation fees I hope net neutrality gets killed, and all you fuckers who are polluting this space with this stupid campaign will cry in your moms basement for the rest of your lives.

It's especially tiresome as I'm not American.How do I filter out these stupid net neutrality posts on Reddit?Something doesn't smell right...

First false information in a formula:

"these big companies support net neutrality, so it's bad", then they proceed to list companies that are actually AGAINST NN.

https://www.opensecrets.org/news/issues/net_neutrality/

VERIZON, ATT, COMCAST have all lobbied excessively AGAINST NN.

There is a reason. You need to dig deeper to understand. They aren't trying to stop censorship. They are censorship. They already censor all over the web. They already censor media from trending on social media. They tell us some links are fake news. Hell, they censor us on this website right now. The hypocrisy is overwhelming. The censorship is here. What people don't get is that it is already happening but ask yourself if sites are already being censored then why do the globalists want NN? It's real simple. They will selectively enforce. They will allow their buddies to break the rules and enforce the rules against their opponents. Better to remove the rules so everyone is on an even playing field and then use anti trust laws already on the books to stop them from targeting businesses. Before NN there were almost no cases of actual abuse. Don't give me some bs link about some isp in Canada. Also, all that abuse was already illegal based on our current laws for antitrust and consumer protections. Right now we need to get rid of the title 2 regulations so people can get more service provider options. Then if your isp starts slowing certain traffic you can switch.

There is an end game here. It is not just what you see right now on the front page. Remove NN, remove title 2, allow more ISPs to compete, if they provide bad service you can switch to one that will not slow traffic. That is the real plan, not reddit's bullshit. And if you want to argue the ISPs will not compete because they like to create monopolies I still say it's better to have no regulation and antitrust laws than regulation that can be selectively enforced by the globalists if they get the right people in office. We aren't going to let them control everything. Things were working just fine before NN and they will work just fine after NN.[removed]All of you are dick suckers Yeah but how tf am I supposed to know if this isn't some sort of scam to get my number for a telemarketer list, how is giving some random website my phone number gonna do anything?

I hope you redeem yourself in 2021.Your existence is so bland that this is the first time I've even heard of this roastathon despite being a daily redditor.

My one consolation for being late to the party is that I will soon forget you.Ah, the smell.So much wasted printer ink... and lifeYou look like the person, who would come up in Google after searching "sex offender"Jesus christ man get a lifeI’ve forgotten you 365 times.I don’t think it’s a coincidence that the year you did this was the worst year of people’s lives.I still hate you.Wtf is actually wrong with youGrats,  but your big toe is rotting offYou have nothing better to do than being insulted online, congrats and happy New yearYet another reason I can’t wait for 2021.Fuck you for trying to make us remember that you existThank Christ. I didn't give a shit about you then, I don't give a shit about you now. You are gone after today, and everyone but you will get on with their lives, you delusional, sheltered, wretched cretin.Was hoping Covid was only going to give us 57 of your posts.And you had to pick a leap year.There are others who wanted to get roasted on this sub, but you never gave them a chance with all your karma-whoring.  Go fuck yourself.This guy is such a nobody he’s been on here every day for a year and this is the first post I’ve seen.That's a really interesting mustache! Is it difficult keeping the required distance from schools and playgrounds?Attention whoring for karma at its best.Its a shame you spent the year inside taking photos of yourself. You could have done us all a favour and gone outside got covid and died. 2021 already started with disappointmentYou crazy son of a bitch you did You itGet a life asswipe.You were the worst thing about 2020It’s not every day you get to see the focus of an episode of *Mindhunter* before it even films.Finally you can beat off on all those pictures and leave us alone.Are. those pictures of the only human you’ve had sex with?Hopefully that toenail isn't painted and you just dropped a hammer on it.I don’t browse this sub often, I’ve only seen two of these posts but I never want to see your dumbass shortbus riding narcissist face again. How you didn’t get banned for spamming posts blows my mind. Good riddance, don’t come back.You are a Dork's Dork.Some folks take Reddit way to serious.  To be this committed to Reddit for a year, then go and get the photos printed, then hang them all on the wall....  there's something deeper going on with this guy.You look like if Kip from Napoleon Dynamite had never met La’FawndaMake A Wish version of Weird Al Yankovic.Good thing it was a leap year so people had an extra day to burn you to a crispThis is the gayest picture collage I've ever seen.Moderators, you can now block his ass off this sub.You’re that idiot teenage girls call an “inspiration”.The last person to see JonBenet Ramsey.You look like if Rivers Cuomo was even whiterwait, you're _who_, now?  sorry, guess I haven't seen you post, before...This is a weenie roastBruh , get a lifeThis guy’s room is Chris Hanson’s wet dream.Dude’s probably got the personality of an unseasoned boiled potatoSo will this twat stop posting now?I think you meant to write "help i'm desprate for any kind of attension"You basically used last year to plead for some attention that you most likely didn't have in 2019, but because it was on here, you bot bad attention, and so someone'll be using a sniper rifle to assassinate your Ned Flanders look.Isn't there 365 days in a yearYou can gauge the success of your life based on how many walls your bed touches.You took a picture for every different split personality you have.wtf don't u have a hobbyYou look like that creepy guy from One Hour PhotoNever noticed you. Another thing you failed.Is it too late to go back and downvote every one of your fucking posts loser??Bro get a jobYou have one picture for every kiddy fiddledI’m so annoyed this got upvotes. This kid is seriously fucking annoyingHow much time do you spend on reddit? If I had that much time I would have fucking started and finished my book already.He paints his toenails and has a porn stash?  EwwLess than 2% women on the wall Dahmer![gif](giphy|gQS08du7iynPq)Your moustache says: im a slavic from the '80s. LolBleach your teeth, 'cuz you definitely don't have the whitest smile I ever come across.You're not even the top of the last yearThe next time we see you will be on a Netflix miniseries about the *other photos* you have.

By other photos I mean your massive collection of child porn.Pictures of all his victims are on the wall. The next ones are out on his bed. He looks like a cross between Ned Flanders and Jeffrey Dauhmer.When Jeffrey Dahmer thinks of us as his "friends".Seems more like a customized padded room  .... hmm makes sense ...hows the jelloYou look like a stereotypical sex offenderThis guy have more Bitcoin than he has friendsIn all honesty, I wish I had your confidence.What psycho has pictures of himself?That picture screams 40 yr old virgin. But the clothes say chloroform.Last picture will be his MUGSHOT , posted by his momFane boy muchYou look like you own a van that has the words  free candie sprayed on the side of it.Are you on house arrest for stalking little children for the last 366 days?Your wayward pinky is grotesque.Maybe post quarterly next year, the first day of each season? Take good care of the cats, they looked pretty adorable.Look at this guy, he has so little to live for that he gets roasted for a year. 

Srsly tho,  congrats man, that takes a lot of dedication.I guess you have a learning disorder?Jesus fucking christ get a hobby.No roast today. Best of luck to you and your family.No roast, but I gotta admire the perseverance!We all know you’re going to jack off all over this tonightYou look like you're a 40 year old with the mental age of a 10 year old.And he's learned nothingJesus Christ. I’m gonna need that stimulus check ASAP to make your 2020 bullshit worth it.A picture says 1000 words but yours say a few sentences.You look like every teacher from the 70sMy name is Inigo Montoya. You stole my mustache, prepare to die!I'd say you did good but that's probably the most effort you've put into anything....ever.
Besides that stacheYou have wasted your timeIs your room huge or are you just small?I don’t know which is more disappointing - your sad life or the fact that the worst infection you got in 2020 was under that toenail.Seems perfectly roasted to me.I’m not sure how to tell you this.....Your teeth are green.The multicoloured sign doesn’t distract from your essence of boringKinda weird to have a shrine of everyone you’ve ever had sex withI’d pay money to watch a livestream of you bringing a girl home and not mentioning that you have almost 400 pics of you above your bed😂 oh yea the roast uhhhh

I bet your grandpa is Dennis Rader. Is that the blood of your victims on your toenails?I want to say thank you from the very bottom of my heart! For helping me discover God. I was on reddit every single day during Quarantine and I haven't seen your mug once. This got me thinking, that there truly is a being above all. Thank you your holiness for safe guarding me in 2020 from both Covid and this monstrosity this man calls a face. Amen.Imagine your life having so little value that you think making a reddit post everyday is an accomplishment worth celebrating.Not today. Happy New Year, friend!!He looks like Ned Flanders in real life, except for the part where he paints his toenails black.You look like the kind of guy who would post on roast me for 366 days, and keep a photo of each one.This dude's a loser, that's not even a roast, who does this?We don't roasted burnt thingsNice ego-braryI don’t envy all the therapy you’ll needYou're the most roasted man i ever seen if you were roast beef you would've been charred to charcoalOf all the things you could channel this level of dedication you managed to pick one of the least productive ones.

Get off of reddit and get a real life.What’s up with his big toenail?I think you underestimate the neediness, sir.That is an ugly wallpaperYou even get dressed up for this anniversary and put some nail polish on your feets.

Real American Heroes

Today we salute you, Mr. Broke-Bentley-Owner.

You finally bought that dream car you always wanted. But you’re too old to get any decent pussy with it.You sound like a db Narcissist!  You are not
Thinking about your future, Willing to spend everything you have today so you can maximize your current feeling of self worth.  Your quality of life will fall faster than the value of your stupid car!This guy is tired of winningI think you'll give yourself your "best shot", when you're about 56, living in a motel 6 with what's left after you sold your Bentley. That being said you would've made some impression on someone... The poor traumatized room service lady, left to clean up the mess.How do I not become youIs this me in my future.So you drive an old Bentley and think that’ll get you the attention you crave?   As soon as you step out if it, people will realize you don’t have any money while looking at your faded 12 year old GAP shirt.

Edit:  oops, I meant JC Penny.Fuck it, dude. Let's go bowling.Wait, almost 50 year olds use reddit?Not a roast, just genuinely curious why you would choose to drive a Bentley in your situation. Seems like a TERRIBLE financial decision.Nice to know what Sam Axe from Burn Notice is up to these days.Damn you got a Bentley while living in an area where you need bars on the windows? Nah make sure you return that exotic rental before you run out of money to pay the rental fee.Man, I hope you live in one of a handful of states, because you might not be working at a bank much longer.

If there's one thing that history proves, it's that internet posts about drug use NEVER bite anyone in the ass.

But hey, at least then you'll still have no savings, won't own a home, and no retirement!What I wanna know is how you haven't got a home but having a fucking bentleyYou must be king of r/wallstreetbetsAre you sure you work at the bank? Looks like you are going to start heist.For some reason, I believe everything you've written here.You're 46 yr old, work at a bank, have no savings, don’t own a home, have nothing saved for retirement, and you drive a Bentley and smoke bong hits on the toilet.You are the human equivalent of potential sitting on a shelf far past its expiration date.He’s.. unroastable.This is the “before” picture  prior to you walking inside and hearing Chris Hansen say “Why don’t you take a seat...”Prolly uses his toilet for his bong waterAnyone can take pictures at a dealershipThe ‘I peaked in high school’ starter kitWorst financial advisor everHmm.. seems like a trust fund baby who’s dad still makes have a job so they can still get part of their pensionI dont like kicking a man while he's downTook you 46 years to become a halfway succesful 22 year old.You look like Santa's bagYou look like a wannabe zodiac killerSeems unfulfilling.you’re everything i’m afraid of becomingThanks for reminding me to take care of myself."I peaked in high school"Considering you've put ALL your money into a car, could have chosen a better car. Not a 60year olds car.I see your neighbors are aware that you don’t have a retirement plan. When you say that you “work at a bank”, don’t you mean that you show up at a bank from time to time wearing a ski mask?Why did I directly assume you were single?Wow.
